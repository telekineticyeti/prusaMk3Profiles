# Prusa Mk3 profiles

This repo is a collection of slic3r configuration bundles for our Prusa Mk3 FDM Printer.

While the main goal of this repo is to sync filament profiles between different machines, please be aware that it may contain settings, functions or gcodes that are specific to our printer or enclosure environment.

As such it is **not recommended** that you import these slic3r configs unless you are certain of what you are doing.

We are not responsible if your printer devours your cat.
