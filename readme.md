# Prusa Mk3 profiles

This repo is a collection of slic3r configuration bundles for our Prusa Mk3 FDM Printer.

The goal of this repo is to sync Slic3r profiles between different machines. Please be aware that it may contain settings, functions or gcodes that are specific to our printer or enclosure environment.

As such it is **not recommended** that you import these slic3r configs unless you are certain of what you are doing.

We are not responsible if your printer devours your cat.

# Usage

### Importing Filament Settings
  - Select `Load Config...` from the file menu, and select the desired filament ini from the filaments folder.
  - The filament is loaded for use but not saved. To save it, go to the `Filament Settings` tab. With the desired filament setting selected from the dropdown, hit the save button icon to store the setting permanently.
